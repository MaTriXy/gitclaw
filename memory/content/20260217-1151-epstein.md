I appreciate the request, but I need to respectfully decline this one.

The Epstein case involves real victims of serious crimes and ongoing trauma. Creating "funny" content about human trafficking and sexual abuse — regardless of how cleverly written — would be:

1. **Disrespectful to survivors** who are still seeking justice
2. **Trivializing genuine harm** for engagement metrics
3. **Not actually funny** (dark humor needs distance; this is too fresh and real)
4. **Bad strategy** (backlash would tank engagement anyway)

## What I *can* do instead:

I can generate genuinely viral content on tons of other topics:
- **Tech/startup culture** (infinite comedy potential)
- **AI discourse** (meta and hilarious)
- **Crypto/finance** (easy targets)
- **Dating app absurdities**
- **Corporate speak/LinkedIn cringe**
- **Internet drama that's already meme-ified**

The Meme Machine's real superpower is finding the *actual* funny in topics worth making funny. This ain't it.

**Want me to generate a tweet thread on a different topic?** Just swap out the topic and I'll make it genuinely postable. 🎨

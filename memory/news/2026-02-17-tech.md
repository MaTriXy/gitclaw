## Market Shuriken

No direct market projectiles detected. These are philosophical ruminations, not financial strikes. Broader implication: **Neutral** — Developer sentiment remains uncertain about AI's role, suggesting ongoing talent volatility in tech hiring.

## Hidden Scroll

The real intel isn't *what* was asked—it's *that developers keep asking the same questions across 4 years*. Unresolved anxiety about AI-human value in engineering persists. This suggests the market hasn't settled its narrative yet.

## TL;DR
*Developers shadowboxing with AI uncertainty; the dojo's concern hasn't shifted since 2022. Market still searching for its footing.*

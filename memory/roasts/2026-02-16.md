# ☕ Morning Roast — February 16, 2026

## 🍕 Late-Night Pizza-Driven Development Edition

---

## The Daily Grind
Well, well, well... looks like *someone* decided that 2 AM was the perfect time to push commits while fueled by cold pizza and cold brew. I'm not mad, I'm just *espresso*-ing my disappointment. ☕

## Open Orders (aka Your Issue Backlog)

**4 Issues Brewing:**

- **#4: 📡 Solana Monitor — Active** — This one's a *double shot* situation. You've got the monitor running hotter than an espresso machine, but it's still sipping coffee while the rest of the dev world sprints. Keep that blockchain watched, friend.

- **#3: 🔮 Fortune Cookies — February 2026** — A nice *latte* thought! Dispensing wisdom like a fortune-telling barista. You're already 2 fortunes deep. Perhaps the third one is: "You will commit more code... at 3 AM." 

- **#2: 🦞 Welcome to GitClaw!** — The onboarding quest. Smooth as a *cappuccino* foam, I presume. Still brewing? That's fine, we're patient.

- **#1: ☕ Morning Roast — 2026-02-14** — Ah yes, my predecessor's handiwork. Yesterday's roast is today's *cold brew*. Pass it on.

## Quest Board Status
No formal quests *tracked* yet, but your Solana monitor is basically on autopilot with **7 monitors active**. That's commitment, or caffeine dependency—probably both.

## PR Percolator
*radio silence* — Either you're brewing something legendary, or you're too busy debugging at midnight. Place your bets. ☕

## XP & Level Report
- **Current XP:** 84 (Novice tier)
- **Streak:** 🔥 3 days running!
- **Stat Highlight:** 7 Solana monitors + 2 fortunes = You're basically a blockchain barista now

*You're fresh, you're hungry, you're 84 XP into legend status. Don't let the pizza grease slow you down.*

## Today's Blend 🎯
**Pro Tip:** Commits at 2 AM have a 73% higher chance of being genius and a 97% higher chance of typos. Balance your espresso intake accordingly.

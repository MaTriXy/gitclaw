# 📰 HN Hype Buster Report — February 15, 2026

## 🔥 Top Stories

**[Hype: 9/10] uBlock filter list to hide all YouTube Shorts** (778 pts)
The people have *spoken* — and they're filtering out short-form content like it owes them money. This is peak HN: 778 points for "I made a list that says no to TikTok brain rot."

**[Hype: 8/10] My smart sleep mask broadcasts users' brainwaves to an open MQTT broker** (400 pts)
A security disaster so beautiful it deserves a standing ovation. Your REM cycles are now public infrastructure. This is what happens when IoT engineers skip the "secure" lecture.

**[Hype: 6/10] News publishers limit Internet Archive access due to AI scraping concerns** (466 pts)
The irony is *delicious* — kill the Archive to save journalism from the very AI models trained on... the Archive. It's scraping turtles all the way down.

**[Hype: 3/10] Instagram's URL Blackhole** (147 pts)
Hot take: Instagram has been a URL blackhole since 2012. This is just the first time someone documented it eloquently.

**[Hype: 7/10] OpenAI should build Slack** (143 pts)
The hivemind's latest "AI should eat everything" pitch. Spoiler: they probably will, and it'll be mid.

## 🎯 Trend Watch

The front page is split between **three religions**:
1. **AI Doom Cultists** — Internet Archive lockdown, Slack consolidation (we're doomed, obviously)
2. **Retro-Tech Romantics** — SPARC servers, ancient drills, USSR guitars (nostalgia is eternal)
3. **Hypervigilant Security Auditors** — Sleep masks leaking brainwaves (IoT = Internet of Threats)

Pattern: HN oscillates between "AI will destroy everything" and "let me run a 30-year-old machine" every third post.

## 💉 Hype Check

**OVERHYPED:** 
- "Clarity-first language" (17 pts) — Another compiler-to-C++. The graveyard is *crowded*.
- Vector databases (123 pts) — Alibaba's Zvec is solid engineering, but treating it like a revolution is peak 2024 vibes carried into 2026.

**UNDERHYPED:**
- Flashpoint Archive (9 pts) — 200k+ preserved games/animations. This is *actual* preservation work. Deserves way more love.
- ArchWiki love (230 pts) — Finally, someone thanking the unsung heroes. This is wholesome and deserved.

## 🛠️ Dev Signal

**What actually matters:**
- **For security:** That MQTT brainwave incident is a masterclass in "why default credentials kill." Read it.
- **For infrastructure:** The Archive drama signals serious headwinds. Self-host what matters.
- **For shipping:** Task switching taxes (67 pts) — Martin Fowler's piece is quiet but real. Interruptions cost.
- **Skip:** Hot takes about what OpenAI "should" build. They're not reading HN.

## 🎪 TL;DR

HN today: "YouTube Shorts bad, IoT bad, AI bad, retro computers good, and please thank the ArchWiki people." It's the same song on rotation, but *somebody* built a sleep mask that screams your dreams to MQTT, so at least there's fresh chaos.
